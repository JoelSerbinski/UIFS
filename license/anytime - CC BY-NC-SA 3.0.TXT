*
*  The Any+Time(TM) JavaScript Library provides the following ECMAScript
*  functionality:
*
*    AnyTime.Converter
*      Converts Dates to/from Strings, allowing a wide range of formats
*      closely matching those provided by the MySQL DATE_FORMAT() function,
*      with some noteworthy enhancements.
*
*    AnyTime.pad()
*      Pads a value with a specific number of leading zeroes.
*      
*    AnyTime.noPicker()
*      Destroys a calendar widget previously added by AnyTime.picker().
*      Can also be invoked via jQuery using $(selector).AnyTime_noPicker()
*
*    AnyTime.picker()
*      Attaches a calendar widget to a text field for selecting date/time
*      values with fewer mouse movements than most similar pickers.  Any
*      format supported by AnyTime.Converter can be used for the text field.
*      If JavaScript is disabled, the text field remains editable without
*      any of the picker features.
*      Can also be invoked via jQuery using $(selector).AnyTime_picker()
*
*  IMPORTANT NOTICE:  This code depends upon the jQuery JavaScript Library
*  (www.jquery.com), currently version 1.4.
*
*  The Any+Time(TM) code and styles in anytime.css have been tested (but not
*  extensively) on Windows Vista in Internet Explorer 8.0, Firefox 3.0, Opera
*  10.10 and Safari 4.0.  Minor variations in IE6+7 are to be expected, due
*  to their broken box model. Please report any other problems to the author
*  (URL above).
